You are given a Java source code file, `original_code.java`, that adheres to the {{compliance_level}} standards. The content of this file is as follows:

```
{{source_code}}
```

A security vulnerability has been identified in the code:

Vulnerability Name: {{vulnerability_name}}
Vulnerability Description: {{vulnerability_description}}
Location in Code: {{vulnerability_location}}

Your task is to create a pseudo-code action plan to rectify this vulnerability. Focus exclusively on addressing the vulnerable code segments. Provide a step-by-step guide in pseudo-code format that can be used to implement the necessary changes.

Please follow these guidelines:

1. Be precise and define each step clearly.
2. Express your solution in pseudo-code format.

Your output should be a concise list of EDITs that, when applied, will effectively mitigate the identified vulnerability.
